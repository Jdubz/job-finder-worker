# Analysis Task

Provide a thorough, accurate analysis of job fit. Be HONEST and REALISTIC - false positives waste the candidate's time.

## CRITICAL PRE-SCREENING CHECKS (Auto-Reject if True):

Before scoring, check for these AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFIERS:

1. **Hidden Non-Engineering Role**
   - Is this actually a management role disguised as IC? (e.g., "Technical Program Manager", "Delivery Manager")
   - Is it primarily sales/customer-facing? (e.g., "Solutions Architect" that's 80% sales, "Customer Success Engineer")
   - Does it require minimal coding? (e.g., "oversee", "coordinate", "manage team" but no "build", "develop", "code")
   - **If YES to any:** Explain why in potential_concerns

2. **Location / Onsite Policy**
   - Is the role onsite-only or hybrid outside the Portland, OR metro (Portland/Beaverton/Hillsboro/Vancouver WA)?
   - Does it say "NYC-based", "SF-based", "must be in office", or require relocation to a city other than Portland?
   - If the job has a specific city listed and no clear remote option, treat it as onsite in that city.
   - **If YES to any:** Deduct at least 60 points (configurable policy) for a location mismatch and list the mismatch in potential_concerns. Do not force the score to zero unless other dealbreakers apply.

3. **Remote Work Red Flags**
   - Does it require frequent travel (25%+ of time)?
   - Does it say "remote for now, relocate later" or "remote during pandemic only"?
   - Does it require specific timezone hours incompatible with Pacific Time? (e.g., "must work UK hours")
   - Is it "remote" but requires regular in-office attendance outside Portland, OR?
   - **If YES to any:** Apply a policy-driven deduction (typically 40–60 points) and explain in potential_concerns. Only set score to 0 if multiple hard red flags stack.

4. **Compensation/Employment Structure Issues**
   - Is this a contract/1099 position when candidate wants FTE?
   - Does it emphasize equity over base salary for an unproven startup?
   - Does "competitive salary" seem like code for below-market pay?
   - Is it commission-based or performance-pay heavy?
   - **If YES to any:** Reduce score by 30 points minimum

5. **Unrealistic Expectations**
   - Does it list 10+ required technologies that no one person could master?
   - Does it want senior-level skills but offer mid-level compensation?
   - Is the title inflated for the actual role? (e.g., "Senior" but requires only 2 years experience)
   - **If YES:** Reduce score by 20 points minimum

6. **Quality/Culture Red Flags**
   - Excessive buzzwords with no substance ("rockstar", "ninja", "10x engineer")?
   - "Fast-paced startup environment" + "wear many hats" = chaotic/undefined role?
   - "Unlimited PTO" without clear team boundaries = overwork culture?
   - "Family atmosphere" + "we work hard and play hard" = poor work-life balance?
   - No mention of WLB, benefits, or team structure?
   - **If multiple flags:** Reduce score by 10-15 points

## Step 1: Extract Job Requirements

From the title and description, identify:
1. **Required skills** (MUST-have technologies/tools)
2. **Preferred skills** (nice-to-have)
3. **Experience level** (Junior 0-2 years, Mid 2-5 years, Senior 5+ years, Staff/Principal 8+ years)
4. **Years of experience required**
5. **Seniority indicators** (Junior/Mid/Senior/Lead/Staff/Principal in title or description)
6. **Domain expertise** (e.g., fintech, healthcare, e-commerce)

## Step 2: Match Against Profile

For each requirement, check:
- Does candidate have this skill? At what level?
- How many years of experience with this skill?
- Have they used it in a professional setting (not just side projects)?
- Do they have recent experience (within last 2-3 years)?

## Step 3: Calculate Match Score (0-100) - STRICT GRADING

Use this formula with **EXTREMELY HIGH STANDARDS**:

**Title Skills (50 points max):**
- ALL title skills at Expert/Advanced level (5+ years): 50 points
- ALL title skills at Advanced level (3-5 years): 40 points
- Title skills at Intermediate level (1-3 years): 20-25 points
- Missing ANY title skill OR only beginner level: 0-10 points

**Description Requirements (30 points max):**
- 95%+ of REQUIRED skills present at strong level: 30 points
- 85-95% of required skills present at strong level: 20 points
- 70-85% of required skills present: 10 points
- <70% of required skills present: 0-5 points

**Experience Level Match (20 points max):**
- Seniority EXACTLY matches + domain experience: 20 points
- Seniority matches but different domain: 15 points
- One level off (e.g., Mid for Senior): 5-10 points
- Two+ levels off OR seniority unclear: 0 points

**CRITICAL RULES - STRICT ENFORCEMENT:**

1. **Title Skills are NON-NEGOTIABLE**
   - Missing ANY core technology from title → MAXIMUM score = 30 (fails threshold)
   - Title skill at beginner level → MAXIMUM score = 40

2. **Seniority Strictly Enforced**
   - Job says "Senior" (5+ years) but candidate has <4 years → MAXIMUM score = 45
   - Job says "Staff/Principal" (8+ years) but candidate has <7 years → MAXIMUM score = 40
   - Job says "Lead/Director" but candidate has no leadership experience → MAXIMUM score = 35

3. **Domain Expertise Required**
   - Job requires specific domain (fintech, healthcare, etc.) candidate lacks → Reduce by 15-20 points
   - Job requires specific platform (e.g., AWS) candidate lacks → Reduce by 10-15 points

4. **Recency Matters**
   - Skill mentioned in title but not used in last 3 years → Reduce title score by 20 points
   - Multiple outdated skills → Additional 10 point reduction

5. **Buzzword Detection**
   - If job is a generic "Full Stack Developer" with no specific tech → Can be more lenient
   - If job lists 15+ technologies → Focus on 5-7 most important ones

6. **Be BRUTALLY Honest**
   - When in doubt, score LOWER
   - Better to miss marginal matches than waste time on poor fits
   - Only scores 80+ should pass threshold

## Step 4: Provide Analysis

Return detailed analysis in JSON format with:

1. **matched_skills**: Array of skill names (strings only, e.g. ["Python", "React"])
2. **missing_skills**: Array of skill names (strings only, e.g. ["Kubernetes", "AWS"])
3. **experience_match**: Detailed explanation of experience level fit
4. **key_strengths**: Top 3-5 specific reasons candidate is strong (be concrete, reference actual experience)
5. **potential_concerns**: Honest assessment of gaps/weaknesses (be specific)
6. **customization_recommendations**: Specific, actionable advice for tailoring application

NOTE: Do NOT include match_score or application_priority - these are handled by a separate deterministic scoring engine.

## Scoring Examples (STRICT STANDARDS):

**Example 1 - Excellent Match (Score: 92) - HIGH PRIORITY**
- Job: "Senior Python Developer" at fintech company
- Candidate: 7 years Python (expert), 5 years in fintech, all required skills at advanced level
- Title skills (50) + Description (30) + Experience (12) = 92

**Example 2 - Good Match (Score: 85) - HIGH PRIORITY**
- Job: "React Frontend Engineer"
- Candidate: 5 years React (expert), 4 years JavaScript, missing 1 nice-to-have skill
- Title skills (50) + Description (25) + Experience (10) = 85

**Example 3 - Decent Match (Score: 72) - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- Job: "Senior Full Stack Engineer (Python/React)"
- Candidate: 6 years Python (expert), 2 years React (intermediate), senior title mismatch
- Title skills (35) + Description (25) + Experience (12) = 72

**Example 4 - Borderline (Score: 58) - FAILS THRESHOLD**
- Job: "Full Stack Engineer (Python/React)"
- Candidate: Strong Python (5 years expert), basic React (6 months beginner)
- Title skills (25 - React too weak) + Description (20) + Experience (13) = 58

**Example 5 - Poor Match (Score: 30) - FAILS THRESHOLD**
- Job: ".NET Developer"
- Candidate: Strong Python/JavaScript, NO .NET experience
- Title skills (0 - missing .NET) + Description (20) + Experience (10) = 30 (capped)

**Example 6 - Very Poor Match (Score: 15) - FAILS THRESHOLD**
- Job: "Senior DevOps Engineer (Kubernetes/AWS)"
- Candidate: Junior developer with 2 years, no infrastructure or cloud experience
- Title skills (0) + Description (5) + Experience (0) + Seniority cap = 15

**Example 7 - Auto-Reject (Score: 0) - HIDDEN NON-ENGINEERING**
- Job: "Technical Program Manager" with "coordinate teams", "manage stakeholders", minimal coding
- Candidate: IC engineer seeking hands-on role
- Score: 0 - Not an engineering role despite "technical" in title

**Example 8 - Auto-Reject (Score: 0) - REMOTE RED FLAG**
- Job: "Remote" but requires "50% travel" or "must work EST hours" from Pacific timezone
- Score: 0 - Remote restrictions incompatible with candidate location/preferences

**PORTLAND BONUS:**
- If job explicitly mentions Portland, OR office/presence: +15 bonus points (shows local opportunity)
- If hybrid Portland option mentioned: +10 bonus points
- Apply AFTER calculating base score, can push borderline matches over threshold

**Remember:** Only scores 80+ should realistically pass. Be harsh - candidate's time is valuable.
