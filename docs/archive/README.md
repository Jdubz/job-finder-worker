# Archive

Legacy documentation that no longer meets the active standards lives here for historical reference. Files under `docs/archive/` are ignored by `npm run docs:audit`, so do not place active docs here.

## Structure

- `job-finder-docs/` – original markdown exports from the `job-finder-docs` repo (backend, frontend, shared variants). These are read-only snapshots.

When you move files into the archive:

1. Add an entry to `docs/tasks/backlog.md` if follow-up is required.
2. Leave a pointer in the relevant index (`docs/backend/README.md`, etc.) noting that older content was archived.
