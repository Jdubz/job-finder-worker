# Frontend Documentation

The Vite/React documentation from the legacy FE repo now lives under `docs/frontend/frontend-docs`. This folder mirrors the old Docusaurus layout so existing references stay valid.

## Useful Entry Points

- Legacy FE docs from the old repo now sit in [`docs/archive/job-finder-docs/frontend-docs`](../archive/job-finder-docs/frontend-docs). Treat them as read-only references.
- New frontend proposals, runbooks, and references should live under this directory (create `reference/`, `runbooks/`, etc., as needed) and follow the [documentation guidelines](../DOCUMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md).

## Contributing Notes

- Keep FE-specific RFCs and retro notes under `docs/frontend/`.
- Short setup instructions, lint/test commands, etc., still live in `job-finder-FE/README.md`.
