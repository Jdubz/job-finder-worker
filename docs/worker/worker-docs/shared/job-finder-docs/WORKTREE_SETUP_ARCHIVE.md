# Worktree Setup (Archived)

> **Status:** Deprecated. The repository no longer uses per-worker git worktrees. This file is retained only for historical reference.

[DEPRECATED]
This file is a backup of the previous worktree setup instructions. The repository no longer uses per-worker git worktrees. Work directly in the appropriate repository working copy and push/commit to the `staging` branch.

If you need to restore the original worktree workflow, restore this file to `WORKTREE_SETUP.md` and re-create the `worktrees/` directory.
