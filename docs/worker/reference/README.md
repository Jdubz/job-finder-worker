# Worker References

Curated architecture docs for the Python worker (pipeline states, scheduler config, log schemas).

## Contribution Checklist

1. Start from `docs/templates/reference-template.md`.
2. Link new references here and, when relevant, in `job-finder-worker/README.md`.
3. Update `docs/tasks/backlog.md` if follow-up work is required.

## Example Topics

- State-driven pipeline summary
- Cloud logging schema for worker jobs
- Source submission data contracts
