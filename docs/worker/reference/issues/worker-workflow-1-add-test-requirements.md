# WORKER-WORKFLOW-1 — Add Test Requirements to Deployments

## Issue Metadata

```yaml
Title: WORKER-WORKFLOW-1 — Add Test Requirements to Deployments
Labels: [priority-p0, repository-worker, type-enhancement, status-todo, workflow]
Assignee: TBD
Priority: P0-Critical
Estimated Effort: 1-2 hours
Repository: job-finder-worker
GitHub Issue: #70
```

## Summary

**P0 CRITICAL**: Add comprehensive test requirements to deployment workflows to ensure code quality and prevent broken deployments. Currently deployments can proceed without proper testing validation.

## Background & Context

### Project Overview

**Application Name**: Job Finder Worker  
**Technology Stack**: Python 3.9+, Docker, CI/CD, pytest  
**Architecture**: Containerized Python application with automated deployment

### This Repository's Role

The job-finder-worker repository contains the Python application that processes job queues, performs AI-powered job matching, scrapes job postings, and integrates with job-finder-FE frontend and job-finder-BE backend services.

### Current State

The deployment workflow currently:

- ❌ **No test requirements** in deployment process
- ❌ **Deployments can proceed** without passing tests
- ❌ **No test validation** before deployment
- ❌ **No test coverage requirements** for deployments
- ❌ **Manual testing** not enforced in workflow
- ❌ **No test failure blocking** for deployments

### Desired State

After completion:

- All deployments require passing tests
- Test coverage thresholds enforced
- Test failures block deployment
- Automated test validation in CI/CD
- Clear test requirements documented
- Test quality gates in deployment pipeline

## Technical Specifications

### Affected Files

```yaml
CREATE:
  - .github/workflows/deploy-requirements.yml - Test requirements workflow
  - docs/deployment/TEST_REQUIREMENTS.md - Test requirements documentation
  - scripts/validate_tests.py - Test validation script

MODIFY:
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml - Add test requirements to CI
  - .github/workflows/docker-build.yml - Add test validation to Docker builds
  - .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml - Add test requirements to staging
  - .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml - Add test requirements to production
  - pyproject.toml - Add test requirements configuration
```

### Technology Requirements

**Languages**: Python 3.9+, YAML, Shell Script  
**Frameworks**: GitHub Actions, pytest, coverage.py  
**Tools**: Python testing tools, CI/CD integration  
**Dependencies**: Existing Python dependencies

### Code Standards

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing workflow naming patterns  
**File Organization**: Group test requirements in deployment workflows  
**Import Style**: Use existing Python import patterns

## Implementation Details

### Step-by-Step Tasks

1. **Add Test Requirements to CI Workflow**
   - Require all tests to pass before any deployment
   - Add test coverage threshold enforcement
   - Block deployment on test failures
   - Add test quality gates to CI pipeline

2. **Enhance Docker Build Workflow**
   - Run tests during Docker build process
   - Validate test results before image creation
   - Add test requirements to Docker build
   - Ensure test environment consistency

3. **Update Deployment Workflows**
   - Add test validation to staging deployment
   - Require test passing for production deployment
   - Add test coverage checks to deployment
   - Implement test failure rollback procedures

4. **Create Test Validation Script**
   - Script to validate test requirements
   - Check test coverage thresholds
   - Validate test quality metrics
   - Generate test requirement reports

5. **Document Test Requirements**
   - Document test requirements for deployments
   - Create test quality guidelines
   - Add troubleshooting for test failures
   - Document test validation procedures

6. **Integrate with Existing Workflows**
   - Ensure test requirements work with existing CI/CD
   - Add test requirements to all deployment paths
   - Configure test failure handling
   - Add test requirement monitoring

### Architecture Decisions

**Why this approach:**

- Prevents broken code from reaching production
- Ensures consistent test quality across deployments
- Integrates with existing CI/CD infrastructure
- Provides clear test requirements and validation

**Alternatives considered:**

- Manual test validation: Inconsistent and error-prone
- Post-deployment testing: Too late to prevent issues
- Optional test requirements: Insufficient quality control

### Dependencies & Integration

**Internal Dependencies:**

- Depends on: Existing test suite and CI/CD pipeline
- Consumed by: All deployment workflows and processes

**External Dependencies:**

- APIs: GitHub Actions, testing services
- Services: CI/CD systems, deployment platforms

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Required

**Workflow Tests:**

```python
# Example test requirement validation
def test_deployment_requires_passing_tests():
    """Test that deployment fails if tests don't pass"""
    # Mock test failure
    # Attempt deployment
    # Verify deployment is blocked

def test_coverage_threshold_enforcement():
    """Test that coverage thresholds are enforced"""
    # Mock low coverage
    # Attempt deployment
    # Verify deployment is blocked
```

## Code Examples & Patterns

### Example Implementation

**Test requirements workflow:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-requirements.yml
name: Test Requirements Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, staging]
  push:
    branches: [main, staging]

jobs:
  test-requirements:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install -r requirements-test.txt

      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: |
          pytest --cov=src/job_finder --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=80

      - name: Validate test requirements
        run: |
          python scripts/validate_tests.py

      - name: Check test quality
        run: |
          # Additional test quality checks
          pytest --cov=src/job_finder --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Test validation script:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Test requirements validation script"""

import subprocess
import sys
import json
from pathlib import Path

def validate_test_requirements():
    """Validate that test requirements are met"""
    print("Validating test requirements...")

    # Run tests and check results
    result = subprocess.run([
        'pytest', '--cov=src/job_finder', '--cov-report=json', '--cov-fail-under=80'
    ], capture_output=True, text=True)

    if result.returncode != 0:
        print("Test requirements not met:")
        print(result.stdout)
        print(result.stderr)
        return False

    # Parse coverage report
    coverage_file = Path('coverage.json')
    if coverage_file.exists():
        with open(coverage_file) as f:
            coverage_data = json.load(f)
            total_coverage = coverage_data['totals']['percent_covered']
            print(f"Coverage: {total_coverage:.2f}%")

            if total_coverage < 80:
                print("Coverage below threshold (80%)")
                return False

    print("All test requirements met")
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if not validate_test_requirements():
        sys.exit(1)
```

    logger.error(f"Test requirement failed: {error}")
    # Block deployment
    # Notify team
    # Log failure details
    # Trigger rollback if needed
```
