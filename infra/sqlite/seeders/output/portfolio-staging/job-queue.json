Here, you own your impact to make work more intuitive, joyful, and human—for you as a Dropboxer and for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Join us Own Your Impact Your browser does not support the video tag. Be who you are. Become who you're meant to be. At Dropbox, we don’t just connect workflows. We connect teams and ideas, work and life, artificial intelligence and human brilliance. With the flexibility of a start-up and the opportunities of a global enterprise, you’re expected to push boundaries– and yourself– to shape the future of work. EXPERIMENTATION Redefine possibility. A lab for distributed work where bold ideas become reality. CRAFT Unlock your potential. An opportunity to grow, personally and professionally. COMMUNITY Build connections. A culture that puts humans at the core of what we do. Image in Individual Container VIRTUAL FIRST We're shaping the future of distributed work because we're living it. We believe you do your best work when empowered to be your best self. Our Virtual First model mixes the autonomy of remote work with the connection of in-person collaboration. It’s the best of both worlds: a distributed workplace anchored in community. See how A lab for distributed work We're making an impact from everywhere. Dropboxers collaborate across time zones and continents, while our Studios in San Francisco, Seattle, and Dublin serve as creative hubs where our community comes together to connect, create, and reimagine the future of work. ❮ ❯ Our values Be worthy of trust Millions of teams trust us with their most important information. But this trust can vanish in an instant. That’s why integrity is the foundation of our culture. We do the right thing, even when nobody’s looking. We’re honest—even when it’s uncomfortable. They win, we win Our customers come first. So we put in the work to deeply understand them. We ask, “Who’s the customer?” and “What do they really need?” When they succeed, our business (and everything else) falls into place. Keep it simple Simple things work better—and make more sense. So we build products that do a few things really well. And we don’t overcomplicate life at Dropbox, whether it’s a plan or a process. Getting to simple isn’t always easy, but it’s worth the effort. Own it We take responsibility for our work, from start to finish. When we get stuck, we unblock ourselves. When something goes wrong, we don’t ask, “What did they screw up?” but “What could I do better?” We learn from our mistakes and keep going—until we have real impact. Make work human Our mission is to design a more enlightened way of working, for Dropboxers and the world. So we make products that prioritize our needs as humans. And we build a compassionate culture where you can do your best work—no matter who you are or where you’re from. OWN YOUR IMPACT AT JOBS.DROPBOX.COM #LIFEINSIDEDROPBOX"

Here, you own your impact to make work more intuitive, joyful, and human—for you as a Dropboxer and for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Join us Own Your Impact Your browser does not support the video tag. Be who you are. Become who you're meant to be. At Dropbox, we don’t just connect workflows. We connect teams and ideas, work and life, artificial intelligence and human brilliance. With the flexibility of a start-up and the opportunities of a global enterprise, you’re expected to push boundaries– and yourself– to shape the future of work. EXPERIMENTATION Redefine possibility. A lab for distributed work where bold ideas become reality. CRAFT Unlock your potential. An opportunity to grow, personally and professionally. COMMUNITY Build connections. A culture that puts humans at the core of what we do. Image in Individual Container VIRTUAL FIRST We're shaping the future of distributed work because we're living it. We believe you do your best work when empowered to be your best self. Our Virtual First model mixes the autonomy of remote work with the connection of in-person collaboration. It’s the best of both worlds: a distributed workplace anchored in community. See how A lab for distributed work We're making an impact from everywhere. Dropboxers collaborate across time zones and continents, while our Studios in San Francisco, Seattle, and Dublin serve as creative hubs where our community comes together to connect, create, and reimagine the future of work. ❮ ❯ Our values Be worthy of trust Millions of teams trust us with their most important information. But this trust can vanish in an instant. That’s why integrity is the foundation of our culture. We do the right thing, even when nobody’s looking. We’re honest—even when it’s uncomfortable. They win, we win Our customers come first. So we put in the work to deeply understand them. We ask, “Who’s the customer?” and “What do they really need?” When they succeed, our business (and everything else) falls into place. Keep it simple Simple things work better—and make more sense. So we build products that do a few things really well. And we don’t overcomplicate life at Dropbox, whether it’s a plan or a process. Getting to simple isn’t always easy, but it’s worth the effort. Own it We take responsibility for our work, from start to finish. When we get stuck, we unblock ourselves. When something goes wrong, we don’t ask, “What did they screw up?” but “What could I do better?” We learn from our mistakes and keep going—until we have real impact. Make work human Our mission is to design a more enlightened way of working, for Dropboxers and the world. So we make products that prioritize our needs as humans. And we build a compassionate culture where you can do your best work—no matter who you are or where you’re from. OWN YOUR IMPACT AT JOBS.DROPBOX.COM #LIFEINSIDEDROPBOX"

Learn how to enable JavaScript in your web browser Powering businesses the world over More than four million sellers * run on Square, the only platform of its kind designed for solo entrepreneurs and the largest international chains. About Square Fifteen years ago, not all businesses could accept credit cards. Square set out to change that — inventing the first mobile card reader of its kind. This allowed businesses to take payments anywhere and keep thriving in the economy. It also completely disrupted how the financial system thinks about small businesses. With this shift, Square’s journey took off — moving far beyond its origins as a payment processor to building new tools and solutions for the future. Today, Square is the largest business technology platform serving all kinds of businesses. The Square operating system allows business owners to sell anywhere, work more efficiently, manage inventory, communicate with customers, book appointments, course meals, order online, and so much more. These tools unlock endless possibilities and countless opportunities for any operation from global chains to mom-and-pop shops. 36+ products 8 countries served 4B individual sales transactions processed in 2023* $209.6B in payments processed in 2023* * Source: 2023 10-K Annual Report Read the latest Square news Square Newsroom Get in-depth business insights and exclusive interviews The Bottom Line Learn about our hardware and software Square products An endless evolution Square came to life in 2009 with a card reader for mobile devices — the first of its kind.

So we build products that do a few things really well. And we don’t overcomplicate life at Dropbox, whether it’s a plan or a process. Getting to simple isn’t always easy, but it’s worth the effort. Own it We take responsibility for our work, from start to finish. When we get stuck, we unblock ourselves. When something goes wrong, we don’t ask, “What did they screw up?” but “What could I do better?” We learn from our mistakes and keep going—until we have real impact.

          "careers": "Stripe: Jobs Stripe builds financial infrastructure that ambitious companies use to launch their boldest products. Our customers range from hours-old startups to complex global businesses. Collectively, they are growing the GDP of the internet. You can help. Hear from our leadership Watch video We focus on the details of everything we do, so businesses around the world can focus on what’s most important to them. So Ford can focus on building a global digital dealership , rather than processing payments. So Le Monde can expand its digital offering globally , not reinvent subscription billing. So truckers can focus on getting supply chains moving , not invoicing paper trails. We take pride in freeing up others to work in the spotlight. 14 min read The Collison Brothers Built Stripe Into A $95 Billion Unicorn With Eye-Popping Financials Read on forbes.com 2 min read Ford signs five-year payments deal with Stripe for e-commerce drive Read on cnbc.com 2 min read French Newspaper Le Monde Teams With Stripe to Expand Subscriptions Globally Read on pymnts.com 3 min read Digital Payments Underscore Trucking’s Makeover Read on pymnts.com The leaders in any field make their success look easy. But beneath the surface they’re in constant motion, critiquing their own performance, setting new goals, and continually reevaluating the most basic assumptions about how they approach their work. We’re still in the early stages of our growth and many of our biggest challenges lie ahead. You might think that Stripe has things figured out. While we’re proud of what we’ve built so far, we spend our time thinking about everything we haven’t done yet. Planning means sacrifice: we have great ambitions but limited resources over short time horizons. We are happy that we can support more than 50 payment methods (and accelerate rollout of new ones), incorporate more than 20,000 startups , and galvanize responses to climate change . But every quarter there are many important projects we want to undertake, but can’t. 20 min read A guide to payment methods Read on stripe.com 3 min read Stripe Atlas: the first five years and 20,000 startups Read on stripe.com/blog 2 min read Stripe is paying companies to pull carbon out of the atmosphere Read on fastcompany.com The stack that got us here won’t get us there.

This motivates us to bring in people like you—people who have knowledge and experiences we don’t, and who can quickly bring their talents to bear on hard problems. Stripe is not a pay-your-dues culture; we will train you quickly and then give you substantial responsibility. We often have surprisingly small teams accomplish strikingly important work. The pace of change and velocity of the product force you to pick up new skills, experiment with new tactics, and walk in a variety of users’ shoes. We have to be able to build things quickly to support the fastest growing startups and platforms in the world, while also being reliable, trustworthy, and sometimes profoundly boring. We need to get projects done today, while building infrastructure that the internet will rely upon for decades . We also need to balance an intense work environment against the need to support fulfilling and sustainable careers. 9 min read Stripe: Platform of Platforms Read on stratechery.com 10 min read Stripe: Thinking Like a Civilization Read on readthegeneralist.com 10 min read What Working At Stripe Has Been Like Read on kalzumeus.com Stripe is a team, not a place. We have two headquarters (San Francisco and Dublin), but we belong to the internet. We speak more than 30 languages with our customers and even more with our families. More than 8,000 Stripes build products and support our users from offices in Amsterdam, Bangalore, Barcelona, Berlin, Chicago, Dubai, Dublin, Hyderabad, London, Melbourne, Mexico City, New York, Paris, Prague, São Paulo, San Francisco, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney, Tallinn, Tokyo, Toronto, Warsaw, and Zurich—as well as all the homes and coworking spaces of our remote colleagues . We aspire to make internet payments as ubiquitous and effortless as email. This isn’t simply a matter of ignoring borders; it also requires respectful dialogue with governments, embracing cultural differences, and building products that work in local contexts. That’s why we try to be physically close to our users, too. We want to share cabs with them in Singapore and buy food together in the darshinis of Bangalore. We are grappling with the challenges of operating at an organizational scale that few tech companies reach. We care about our culture and want to preserve the important parts while evolving to meet the needs of new Stripes and our changing business context. We continuously listen to our employees to understand where Stripe truly excels and listen for opportunities to further enhance the way we work as a company and as individuals. I can see the relationship between what I do and the overall mission and priorities of Stripe I feel connected to my team Stripe is in a position to be successful over the next three years My location is not a barrier to my having an impact at Stripe Favorable Neutral Unfavorable Many companies can offer you attractive benefits and compensation. We offer that plus something a bit rarer: the opportunity to work with speed and agility on a platform that has an impact across the entire internet. When you start at Stripe you will go through at least two weeks of in-depth onboarding. We will pair you with experienced team members to show you the ropes. And then you learn by doing. It is common for Stripes to work on things outside their domain of expertise, so we encourage people to regularly attend hands-on classes led by internal and external experts on everything from Learning to Code to Thinking Like a Lawyer. 33 min podcast SaaStr Podcast: Claire Hughes Johnson, COO @ Stripe Listen on saastr.com 4 min read How Stripe teaches employees to code Read on stripe.com/blog Q Kuhns, Internal Communications Before joining the Internal Communications team at Stripe, I headed up a forensic anthropology lab. Stripe is much more lively. Sarah Heck, New Markets Before joining the Entrepreneurship team at Stripe, I was responsible for entrepreneurship, youth, and global civilian outreach policy for the National Security Council. Valerie Williams, Inclusion and Diversity Before joining the People team at Stripe, I had a career in supply chain management. Alia Gurtov, Deployment Strategist Before joining the User Ops team at Stripe and discovering solutions for our users, I worked as a paleoanthropologist and discovered a new hominin species. Meka Asonye, New Business Before joining the Startup & SMB Sales team at Stripe, I managed development and operations for a major league baseball team. Catherine David, Connect Accounts Prior to joining the Connect Accounts team at Stripe, I worked in a physics lab building a system to do quantum measurement and fast-reset of superconducting qubits.

Stripes come from all sorts of professional backgrounds like engineering, design, operations, consulting, government, finance, healthcare, and education. We strive for humility as individuals and as an organization. We know that we can do great things alone, but even greater things together. We have a transparent internal culture. If you are curious about engineering, running startups, corporate strategy, or the global economy, you’ll have experts to learn from. And they’ll be eager to learn from you. There is no magic to working with banking partners in Japan, moving billions of dollars around the world, or pushing the limits of browser animations on our product pages. We have smart people who sweat the details—who start with a blank screen, work until a product is ready, and polish until it is exceptional. You will be able to point to specific, high-impact things that didn’t exist until you created them. Everyone at Stripe thinks about creating the best user experience first, then works backward from there. You came to this page for a reason. Now we hope you’ll take the next step and come talk to us about whether one of our open roles is a good fit. We’re hiring talented people like you all the time. We hope you’re next. Do your best work among people who support, refine, and amplify every piece of it. Stripe hosts undergraduate and graduate interns from around the globe. We have an opinionated set of principles, and we’re happy to be warts-and-all honest about them. We embrace diverse perspectives, ideas, and backgrounds at Stripe. We’re committed to providing equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees. Stripe doesn’t discriminate on the basis of any protected characteristic, including race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion (including religious dress), creed, age, disability (mental and physical), sex, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, medical condition, genetic information, family care or medical leave status, marital status, domestic partner status, military and veteran status (including military spouse status), or any other characteristic protected by US federal, state or local laws, or the laws of the country or jurisdiction where you work. This commitment is also reflected in our candidate experience. We will work with your needs and provide any assistance we can.

Learn how to enable JavaScript in your web browser Powering businesses the world over More than four million sellers * run on Square, the only platform of its kind designed for solo entrepreneurs and the largest international chains. About Square Fifteen years ago, not all businesses could accept credit cards. Square set out to change that — inventing the first mobile card reader of its kind. This allowed businesses to take payments anywhere and keep thriving in the economy. It also completely disrupted how the financial system thinks about small businesses.

Today, Square is the largest business technology platform serving all kinds of businesses. The Square operating system allows business owners to sell anywhere, work more efficiently, manage inventory, communicate with customers, book appointments, course meals, order online, and so much more.

Learn how to enable JavaScript in your web browser Powering businesses the world over More than four million sellers * run on Square, the only platform of its kind designed for solo entrepreneurs and the largest international chains. About Square Fifteen years ago, not all businesses could accept credit cards. Square set out to change that — inventing the first mobile card reader of its kind. This allowed businesses to take payments anywhere and keep thriving in the economy. It also completely disrupted how the financial system thinks about small businesses. With this shift, Square’s journey took off — moving far beyond its origins as a payment processor to building new tools and solutions for the future. Today, Square is the largest business technology platform serving all kinds of businesses. The Square operating system allows business owners to sell anywhere, work more efficiently, manage inventory, communicate with customers, book appointments, course meals, order online, and so much more.
