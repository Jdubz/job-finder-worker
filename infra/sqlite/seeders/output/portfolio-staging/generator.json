These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory.

I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine.

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering.

Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine.

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface.

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface.

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine.

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal.

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

            "body": "- Delivered custom web apps, integrations, and internal tools for Intuit, McDonald’s, Google and others.\n - Built full-stack solutions with React, Node.js, Python; designed GCP deployments for production scale.\n - Implemented featured GCP products as part of Google’s partner program:\n     - Enterprise apps on Dialogflow (natural language pipeline).\n     - Game Servers for a large mobile gaming company.\n - Partnered cross-functionally to design user-focused products and streamline ops workflows.\n\n## Clients\n\n### Intuit\nIntuit's marketing team often needed widgets implemented into their product quickly and efficiently. These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

Customers include software companies building voice products, co-sell partners working with large enterprises, and enterprises solving internal voice AI use cases. The company ended 2024 cash-flow positive with 400+ enterprise customers, 3.3x annual usage growth across the past 4 years, over 50,000 years of audio processed and over 1 trillion words transcribed. There is no organization in the world that understands voice better than Deepgram.\n\nCompany Operating Rhythm\nAt Deepgram, we expect an AI-first mindset—AI use and comfort aren’t optional, they’re core to how we operate, innovate, and measure performance.\n\nEvery team member who works at Deepgram is expected to actively use and experiment with advanced AI tools, and even build your own into your everyday work. We measure how effectively AI is applied to deliver results, and consistent, creative use of the latest AI capabilities is key to success here. Candidates should be comfortable adopting new models and modes quickly, integrating AI into their workflows, and continuously pushing the boundaries of what these technologies can do.\n\nAdditionally, we move at the pace of AI. Change is rapid, and you can expect your day-to-day work to evolve just as quickly. This may not be the right role if you’re not excited to experiment, adapt, think on your feet, and learn constantly, or if you’re seeking something highly prescriptive with a traditional 9-to-5.\n\nOpportunity:\n\nWe're looking for an expert (Senior/Staff) Full Stack Engineer to build the Internal Developer Platform that powers our product and research teams. You will architect and build the web services, UIs, and APIs that empower our engineers to build, test, and deploy sophisticated AI-powered applications with ease. This role is focused on creating a cohesive, self-service environment that streamlines the entire development lifecycle, from code to production.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nDesign, build, and maintain scalable backend services and APIs for our internal developer platform.\n\nDevelop and manage robust data pipelines to support engineering and research workflows.\n\nBuild tooling and automation to enhance developer productivity and streamline CI/CD processes.\n\nCollaborate with product and research teams to integrate new AI capabilities into the platform.\n\nEnsure the reliability, performance, and scalability of the platform's backend infrastructure.\n\nYou’ll Love This Role If You\n\nAre passionate about building intuitive developer tools and user interfaces.\n\nEnjoy designing and implementing elegant, end-to-end developer workflows.\n\nLove solving challenging problems by building robust backend services and APIs.\n\nAre excited about leveraging AI to enhance developer productivity and platform capabilities.\n\nWant to work at the intersection of software engineering, infrastructure, and AI.\n\nIt’s Important To Us That You Have\n\n5+ years of experience in full-stack software development.\n\nProficiency in both front-end (e.g., React, Vue) and back-end (e.g., Python, Go, Node.js) development.\n\nDemonstrated experience building internal developer platforms or similar developer-centric tooling.\n\nExpertise in leveraging AI APIs or building applications on top of large language models.\n\nExperience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration platforms (Kubernetes).\n\nA strong understanding of CI/CD principles and building automated pipelines.\n\n  \n\nIt Would Be Great if You Had \n\nExperience with Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi).\n\nKnowledge of cost optimization strategies for cloud infrastructure.\n\nExperience contributing to open-source developer tools."

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

        "jobDescriptionText": "Company Overview\nDeepgram is the leading voice AI platform for developers building speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS) and full speech-to-speech (STS) offerings. 200,000+ developers build with Deepgram’s voice-native foundational models – accessed through APIs or as self-managed software – due to our unmatched accuracy, latency and pricing. Customers include software companies building voice products, co-sell partners working with large enterprises, and enterprises solving internal voice AI use cases. The company ended 2024 cash-flow positive with 400+ enterprise customers, 3.3x annual usage growth across the past 4 years, over 50,000 years of audio processed and over 1 trillion words transcribed. There is no organization in the world that understands voice better than Deepgram.\n\nCompany Operating Rhythm\nAt Deepgram, we expect an AI-first mindset—AI use and comfort aren’t optional, they’re core to how we operate, innovate, and measure performance.\n\nEvery team member who works at Deepgram is expected to actively use and experiment with advanced AI tools, and even build your own into your everyday work. We measure how effectively AI is applied to deliver results, and consistent, creative use of the latest AI capabilities is key to success here. Candidates should be comfortable adopting new models and modes quickly, integrating AI into their workflows, and continuously pushing the boundaries of what these technologies can do.\n\nAdditionally, we move at the pace of AI. Change is rapid, and you can expect your day-to-day work to evolve just as quickly. This may not be the right role if you’re not excited to experiment, adapt, think on your feet, and learn constantly, or if you’re seeking something highly prescriptive with a traditional 9-to-5.\n\nOpportunity:\n\nWe're looking for an expert (Senior/Staff) Full Stack Engineer to build the Internal Developer Platform that powers our product and research teams. You will architect and build the web services, UIs, and APIs that empower our engineers to build, test, and deploy sophisticated AI-powered applications with ease. This role is focused on creating a cohesive, self-service environment that streamlines the entire development lifecycle, from code to production.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nDesign, build, and maintain scalable backend services and APIs for our internal developer platform.\n\nDevelop and manage robust data pipelines to support engineering and research workflows.\n\nBuild tooling and automation to enhance developer productivity and streamline CI/CD processes.\n\nCollaborate with product and research teams to integrate new AI capabilities into the platform.\n\nEnsure the reliability, performance, and scalability of the platform's backend infrastructure.\n\nYou’ll Love This Role If You\n\nAre passionate about building intuitive developer tools and user interfaces.\n\nEnjoy designing and implementing elegant, end-to-end developer workflows.\n\nLove solving challenging problems by building robust backend services and APIs.\n\nAre excited about leveraging AI to enhance developer productivity and platform capabilities.\n\nWant to work at the intersection of software engineering, infrastructure, and AI.\n\nIt’s Important To Us That You Have\n\n5+ years of experience in full-stack software development.\n\nProficiency in both front-end (e.g., React, Vue) and back-end (e.g., Python, Go, Node.js) development.\n\nDemonstrated experience building internal developer platforms or similar developer-centric tooling.\n\nExpertise in leveraging AI APIs or building applications on top of large language models.\n\nExperience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration platforms (Kubernetes).\n\nA strong understanding of CI/CD principles and building automated pipelines.\n\n  \n\nIt Would Be Great if You Had \n\nExperience with Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi).\n\nKnowledge of cost optimization strategies for cloud infrastructure.\n\nExperience contributing to open-source developer tools."

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Coinbase is on a mission to become an &quot;AI-Native&quot; company by 2028, fundamentally transforming how we operate across all functions. As an &lt;strong&gt;AI Growth Lead&lt;/strong&gt; (in an individual contributor capacity), you will drive AI adoption across Coinbase by working within one or more AI Growth Pods — internal accelerators that partner with non-engineering functions (e.g., Finance, HR, Legal, Operations, Marketing, Security) to identify, prototype, and scale high-impact AI automation solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will serve as the &lt;strong&gt;AI Automation DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)&lt;/strong&gt; for your assigned pods, driving initiatives from ideation to initial implementation and broader productionalization, while ensuring these solutions deliver tangible ROI and pave the way for broader AI adoption.

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals—playing on sports teams, traveling—without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n**Skills**: Vanilla JS, unit testing\n\n## Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n**Dialogflow & JLL**\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n**Dialogflow & McDonalds**\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n## Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n**Skills**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n## Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n**Skills**: Docker, Django, Python, React, Raspberry Pi\n\n## Driver's Benefits\nThe client had a massive HIPAA compliant Salesforce instance for case management. Their goal was to help gig workers, specifically drivers, obtain health care through government assistance. We helped them update their workflow to adhere to software best practices, like IAC and unit testing, while maintaining HIPAA compliance.\n**Skills**: Salesforce, Java (Apex)",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n**Skills**: Vanilla JS, unit testing\n\n## Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n**Dialogflow & JLL**\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n**Dialogflow & McDonalds**\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n## Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n**Skills**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n## Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n**Skills**: Docker, Django, Python, React, Raspberry Pi\n\n## Driver's Benefits\nThe client had a massive HIPAA compliant Salesforce instance for case management. Their goal was to help gig workers, specifically drivers, obtain health care through government assistance. We helped them update their workflow to adhere to software best practices, like IAC and unit testing, while maintaining HIPAA compliance.\n**Skills**: Salesforce, Java (Apex)",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

My proficiency in Angular, Node.js (TypeScript), and cloud platforms like GCP, coupled with my experience in building async job pipelines and implementing caching patterns, makes me confident in my ability to contribute significantly to Atlassian's front-end development efforts.",
            "Prior to Fulfil Solutions, as Co-Founder & Lead Engineer at OPNA dev, I delivered custom web applications and integrations for clients like Intuit, McDonald’s, and Google. I have extensive experience building full-stack solutions with React, Node.js, and Python, and designing GCP deployments for production scale. Notably, I implemented featured GCP products as part of Google’s partner program, demonstrating my ability to quickly learn and implement new technologies to meet diverse client needs. This adaptability and problem-solving mindset will allow me to quickly integrate into the Atlassian team and contribute to your ongoing projects."

This experience taught me the importance of designing solutions that not only work but also deliver tangible value - a principle I see echoed in Coinbase's approach to AI adoption.",

I’m excited about the prospect of collaborating with high-caliber colleagues to drive AI adoption and leave a lasting mark on the financial system."

It's probably why I ended up spending years tinkering with CNC machines before diving into the world of software. When I stumbled upon Cloudflare's mission to build a better Internet, it felt like a natural extension of my own journey - creating seamless, secure experiences for everyone online.",

            "At Fulfil Solutions, I had the chance to scale our platform from stealth mode to powering automated grocery stores for big names like DoorDash and Whole Foods. It was all about integrating partners and crafting APIs that made complex systems work together smoothly. This experience taught me the art of collaboration and strategic planning, which I see as a perfect fit for the Partner Account Manager role with WWT at Cloudflare. I love the idea of activating and operationalizing partnerships to expand sales reach - it's like solving a giant puzzle with real-world impact.",
            "What really excites me about Cloudflare is your commitment to innovation and inclusivity. Projects like Galileo and Athenian show a dedication to protecting the free Internet, which resonates with my own values of creating open and accessible technology. I’m eager to bring my experience in channel management and SaaS sales to help drive Cloudflare’s mission forward, especially in a role that blends strategic relationship building with technical enablement."
