      "description": "About Us\n\nAt Cloudflare, we are on a mission to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world's largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World's Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&nbsp;\nWe realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&nbsp;\nLocation: London / Lisbon\nWhat you'll do\nWe're looking to expand the team building our AI Agent, Cloudy. We're looking for someone who is experienced (or at least interested in getting up to speed quickly) with technologies powering AI agents, and integrating them with Cloudflare's products and services. Cloudflare has a robust AI tooling offering like AI Gateway, Workers AI, workflows and others. You must also have a strong background in building the entirety of an application, from the user interface to the apis powering it.\nWe believe that great design is at the heart of any successful product. You will work closely with our design/UX team and must be comfortable seeking feedback from non-technical sources. We work iteratively and deploy often (can be several times a day). We build and maintain the Cloudflare Dashboard, a large TypeScript / React application, maintain a suite of common components published on npm, and build/package with Webpack. Other technologies we use include Redux, Fela, GraphQL, Apollo, Jest, Enzyme, Cypress, D3 and more.&nbsp;\nDesirable skills, knowledge and experience\n\nMinimum of 2 years experience building product\nStrong fullstack engineering experience, with a bias towards Javascript/Typescript\nExperience with building llm-powered applications and/or AI agents\nTrack record of building great interfaces and being detail oriented\nAbility to work in cross-functional teams\nWillingness to dive deep and understand product internals\nExcellent debugging skills\nUnit/integration testing experience\n\nBonus Points\n\nFamiliarity with the Cloudflare Developer Platform (extra bonus points for Agents Library)\nExperience working alongside user researchers to build products\nHistory of building products in complex systems\nKnowledge of the broader Internet technologies (DNS, networking, etc)\nWhat Makes Cloudflare Special?\nWe're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.\nProject Galileo: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers--at no cost.\nAthenian Project: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.\n1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.\nSound like something you'd like to be a part of? We'd love to hear from you!\nThis position may require access to information protected under U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations. Please note that any offer of employment may be conditioned on your authorization to receive software or technology controlled under these U.S. export laws without sponsorship for an export license.\nCloudflare is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. &nbsp;We are committed to providing equal employment opportunity for all people and place great value in both diversity and inclusiveness. &nbsp;All qualified applicants will be considered for employment without regard to their, or any other person's, perceived or actual race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, physical or mental disability, medical condition, family care status, or any other basis protected by law. We are an AA/Veterans/Disabled Employer.\nCloudflare provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities. &nbsp;Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation to apply for a job.

It's a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform - and with it, the future global financial system.\nTo achieve our mission, we're seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company's hardest problems.\nOur work culture is intense and isn't for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there's no better place to be.\nWhile many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.Security is a primary competency at Coinbase, and the Security Operations team keeps a watchful eye over every aspect of it. Every day, we go to battle against some of the most sophisticated attackers in the world to protect billions of dollars worth of digital assets and ensure that our customers and employees can enjoy a safe, trusted experience. As Coinbase scales globally, our team is scaling along with it, using a blend of tooling, automation, and strategic team growth to ensure that we're well-equipped to protect the next billion users of crypto.\nWhat you'll be doing (ie. job duties):&nbsp;\nThe Security Operations group is a multi-functional organization that includes our CSIRT, Trust &amp; Safety,&nbsp; Threat Intelligence, and Insider Threat. While no two days will end up looking the same, generally-speaking you'll be responsible for the following things:\n\nBuilding and implementing detections, preventions, security controls, and automations to not only deter insider threats but improve holistic security posture\nTesting and maintaining security tooling, particularly for endpoint detection and investigation\nCollaborating cross-functionally with Security, Infrastructure, IT, and Legal to obtain necessary technical information and to evaluate and advise them of downstream impacts of their builds/deployments\nLinking disparate information such that it can be aggregated, visualized, and interpreted for indications of threat (via query builds, table joins, etc.)&nbsp;\nAssisting with investigations as needed (this may involve rapidly building tools or extending&nbsp; capabilities to aid response efforts).&nbsp;\n\nWhat we look for in you (ie. job requirements):&nbsp;\n&nbsp;You'll be much more likely to be successful in this role if these bullet points seem like a good description of you:\n\nYou have experience designing and implementing Insider Threat technologies (such as Security Information Event Management - SIEM, User Behavioral Analytics - UEBA, Data Loss Prevention - DLP) and an understanding of investigations and/or the intelligence cycle\nYou are comfortable manipulating logs, tables, and data lakes to engineer custom&nbsp; detections and&nbsp; dashboards&nbsp;\nYou've mastered SQL and coding languages like Python and regularly manipulate logs to create custom alerts and automations with SOAR\nYou are comfortable working cross-functionally with infrastructure, IT, and response teams to design and implement technical controls&nbsp;\nYou are actively aware of the insider threat landscape, and understand the legal, regulatory, and ethical considerations of working with sensitive information and situations\nYou are discreet, thoughtful, and seek to coordinate systemic, cross functional&nbsp; solutions to mitigate risk\nYou are adept at translating complex problems into 'byte-sized', readily implemented (and preferably automated) solutions\nYou have excellent verbal and written communication skills. Other team members ask for your input to communicate clearly and concisely and you are comfortable composing briefs and assessments consumed by leadership and training others\nYou prefer to play as a team and are equally comfortable as the 'novice' or the 'expert'&nbsp;\nYou know that people aren't stupid, but everyone makes mistakes. Your high degree of empathy means that your coworkers trust you to help tackle their security problems, because you never come across as judgmental or condescending.\nYou bring 5-10&nbsp; years or more of combined experience in security/technology or other analytic roles\n\nNice to haves:\n\nUnicorns welcome! You would bring a diverse perspective to the team: for example,&nbsp; maybe you took an unconventional route to get into your current security career.\nYou're familiar with blockchains, cryptocurrency, and onchain projects (or at least a good story about how you thought about investing in Bitcoin in 2014 but decided not to).\nYou love crafting metrics that make the intangible tangible\nYou've got experience in one or more of the following areas: incident response, data protection, risk management, counterintelligence, fraud detection, intellectual property theft, access and identity management, or IT engineeringJob #:&nbsp;P72585\n#LI-Remote\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPay Transparency Notice: The target annual salary for this position can range as detailed below. Full time offers from Coinbase also include&nbsp;bonus eligibility + equity eligibility + benefits (including medical, dental, and vision)\nPay Range:£122,400&mdash;£136,000 GBPPlease be advised that each candidate may submit a maximum of four applications within any 30-day period.
