These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware.

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface.

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors—especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together—sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

        "jobDescriptionText": "Company Overview\nDeepgram is the leading voice AI platform for developers building speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS) and full speech-to-speech (STS) offerings. 200,000+ developers build with Deepgram’s voice-native foundational models – accessed through APIs or as self-managed software – due to our unmatched accuracy, latency and pricing. Customers include software companies building voice products, co-sell partners working with large enterprises, and enterprises solving internal voice AI use cases. The company ended 2024 cash-flow positive with 400+ enterprise customers, 3.3x annual usage growth across the past 4 years, over 50,000 years of audio processed and over 1 trillion words transcribed. There is no organization in the world that understands voice better than Deepgram.\n\nCompany Operating Rhythm\nAt Deepgram, we expect an AI-first mindset—AI use and comfort aren’t optional, they’re core to how we operate, innovate, and measure performance.\n\nEvery team member who works at Deepgram is expected to actively use and experiment with advanced AI tools, and even build your own into your everyday work. We measure how effectively AI is applied to deliver results, and consistent, creative use of the latest AI capabilities is key to success here. Candidates should be comfortable adopting new models and modes quickly, integrating AI into their workflows, and continuously pushing the boundaries of what these technologies can do.\n\nAdditionally, we move at the pace of AI. Change is rapid, and you can expect your day-to-day work to evolve just as quickly. This may not be the right role if you’re not excited to experiment, adapt, think on your feet, and learn constantly, or if you’re seeking something highly prescriptive with a traditional 9-to-5.\n\nOpportunity:\n\nWe're looking for an expert (Senior/Staff) Full Stack Engineer to build the Internal Developer Platform that powers our product and research teams. You will architect and build the web services, UIs, and APIs that empower our engineers to build, test, and deploy sophisticated AI-powered applications with ease. This role is focused on creating a cohesive, self-service environment that streamlines the entire development lifecycle, from code to production.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nDesign, build, and maintain scalable backend services and APIs for our internal developer platform.\n\nDevelop and manage robust data pipelines to support engineering and research workflows.\n\nBuild tooling and automation to enhance developer productivity and streamline CI/CD processes.\n\nCollaborate with product and research teams to integrate new AI capabilities into the platform.\n\nEnsure the reliability, performance, and scalability of the platform's backend infrastructure.\n\nYou’ll Love This Role If You\n\nAre passionate about building intuitive developer tools and user interfaces.\n\nEnjoy designing and implementing elegant, end-to-end developer workflows.\n\nLove solving challenging problems by building robust backend services and APIs.\n\nAre excited about leveraging AI to enhance developer productivity and platform capabilities.\n\nWant to work at the intersection of software engineering, infrastructure, and AI.\n\nIt’s Important To Us That You Have\n\n5+ years of experience in full-stack software development.\n\nProficiency in both front-end (e.g., React, Vue) and back-end (e.g., Python, Go, Node.js) development.\n\nDemonstrated experience building internal developer platforms or similar developer-centric tooling.\n\nExpertise in leveraging AI APIs or building applications on top of large language models.\n\nExperience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration platforms (Kubernetes).\n\nA strong understanding of CI/CD principles and building automated pipelines.\n\n  \n\nIt Would Be Great if You Had \n\nExperience with Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi).\n\nKnowledge of cost optimization strategies for cloud infrastructure.\n\nExperience contributing to open-source developer tools."

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

Customers include software companies building voice products, co-sell partners working with large enterprises, and enterprises solving internal voice AI use cases. The company ended 2024 cash-flow positive with 400+ enterprise customers, 3.3x annual usage growth across the past 4 years, over 50,000 years of audio processed and over 1 trillion words transcribed. There is no organization in the world that understands voice better than Deepgram.\n\nCompany Operating Rhythm\nAt Deepgram, we expect an AI-first mindset—AI use and comfort aren’t optional, they’re core to how we operate, innovate, and measure performance.\n\nEvery team member who works at Deepgram is expected to actively use and experiment with advanced AI tools, and even build your own into your everyday work. We measure how effectively AI is applied to deliver results, and consistent, creative use of the latest AI capabilities is key to success here. Candidates should be comfortable adopting new models and modes quickly, integrating AI into their workflows, and continuously pushing the boundaries of what these technologies can do.\n\nAdditionally, we move at the pace of AI. Change is rapid, and you can expect your day-to-day work to evolve just as quickly. This may not be the right role if you’re not excited to experiment, adapt, think on your feet, and learn constantly, or if you’re seeking something highly prescriptive with a traditional 9-to-5.\n\nOpportunity:\n\nWe're looking for an expert (Senior/Staff) Full Stack Engineer to build the Internal Developer Platform that powers our product and research teams. You will architect and build the web services, UIs, and APIs that empower our engineers to build, test, and deploy sophisticated AI-powered applications with ease. This role is focused on creating a cohesive, self-service environment that streamlines the entire development lifecycle, from code to production.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nDesign, build, and maintain scalable backend services and APIs for our internal developer platform.\n\nDevelop and manage robust data pipelines to support engineering and research workflows.\n\nBuild tooling and automation to enhance developer productivity and streamline CI/CD processes.\n\nCollaborate with product and research teams to integrate new AI capabilities into the platform.\n\nEnsure the reliability, performance, and scalability of the platform's backend infrastructure.\n\nYou’ll Love This Role If You\n\nAre passionate about building intuitive developer tools and user interfaces.\n\nEnjoy designing and implementing elegant, end-to-end developer workflows.\n\nLove solving challenging problems by building robust backend services and APIs.\n\nAre excited about leveraging AI to enhance developer productivity and platform capabilities.\n\nWant to work at the intersection of software engineering, infrastructure, and AI.\n\nIt’s Important To Us That You Have\n\n5+ years of experience in full-stack software development.\n\nProficiency in both front-end (e.g., React, Vue) and back-end (e.g., Python, Go, Node.js) development.\n\nDemonstrated experience building internal developer platforms or similar developer-centric tooling.\n\nExpertise in leveraging AI APIs or building applications on top of large language models.\n\nExperience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration platforms (Kubernetes).\n\nA strong understanding of CI/CD principles and building automated pipelines.\n\n  \n\nIt Would Be Great if You Had \n\nExperience with Infrastructure-as-Code (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi).\n\nKnowledge of cost optimization strategies for cloud infrastructure.\n\nExperience contributing to open-source developer tools."

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n\n### Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n#### Dialogflow & JLL\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n#### Dialogflow & McDonalds\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n\n**Stack**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n#### Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n\n**Stack**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n### Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n\n**Stack**: Docker, React, Raspberry Pi",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n**Skills**: Vanilla JS, unit testing\n\n## Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n**Dialogflow & JLL**\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n**Dialogflow & McDonalds**\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n## Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n**Skills**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n## Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n**Skills**: Docker, Django, Python, React, Raspberry Pi\n\n## Driver's Benefits\nThe client had a massive HIPAA compliant Salesforce instance for case management. Their goal was to help gig workers, specifically drivers, obtain health care through government assistance. We helped them update their workflow to adhere to software best practices, like IAC and unit testing, while maintaining HIPAA compliance.\n**Skills**: Salesforce, Java (Apex)",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n**Skills**: Vanilla JS, unit testing\n\n## Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n**Dialogflow & JLL**\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n**Dialogflow & McDonalds**\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n## Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n**Skills**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n## Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n**Skills**: Docker, Django, Python, React, Raspberry Pi\n\n## Driver's Benefits\nThe client had a massive HIPAA compliant Salesforce instance for case management. Their goal was to help gig workers, specifically drivers, obtain health care through government assistance. We helped them update their workflow to adhere to software best practices, like IAC and unit testing, while maintaining HIPAA compliance.\n**Skills**: Salesforce, Java (Apex)",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n**Skills**: Vanilla JS, unit testing\n\n## Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n**Dialogflow & JLL**\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n**Dialogflow & McDonalds**\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n## Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n**Skills**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n## Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n**Skills**: Docker, Django, Python, React, Raspberry Pi\n\n## Driver's Benefits\nThe client had a massive HIPAA compliant Salesforce instance for case management. Their goal was to help gig workers, specifically drivers, obtain health care through government assistance. We helped them update their workflow to adhere to software best practices, like IAC and unit testing, while maintaining HIPAA compliance.\n**Skills**: Salesforce, Java (Apex)",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

        "jobDescriptionText": "Hi there!\nZapier’s Workflow Zone is responsible for the core engine that powers our automation platform. As more teams and organizations depend on Zapier to automate critical workflows, we’re investing in scaling the capabilities, reliability, and intelligence of our core product experience.\n\nWe’re hiring Frontend Engineers to join several high-impact teams in the Workflow Zone. If you’re passionate about building robust systems, enabling advanced user workflows, and shaping the future of automation, we’d love to hear from you.\n\nThe Workflow Zone is where Zapier’s automation magic happens. This zone owns the product experience and execution engine behind creating, running, and debugging workflows (Zaps). We’re focused on building powerful, flexible tools that help individuals and teams automate their work with speed and confidence.\n\nAs automation use cases grow more complex—especially for Enterprise users—we’re evolving the platform to support more sophisticated logic, scalable execution, and AI-native experiences. This means:\n\nBuilding intuitive and resilient workflow authoring experiences\n\nExpanding execution capabilities and logic primitives\n\nIntroducing AI-powered tools for creation and troubleshooting\n\nImproving reliability, observability, and control across the system\n\nWe’re currently hiring for several teams across the zone, including\n\nEditor Creation\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Editor Creation team is reinventing how users build automations—laying the groundwork for a faster, smarter, and more intuitive workflow authoring experience. Rather than iterating on legacy patterns, this team is redesigning the editor's foundations to support new paradigms like AI-assisted creation and more advanced configuration options.\n\nIn this role, you’ll:\n\nBuild intuitive, responsive, and performant frontend interfaces that power the Zap creation experience\n\nPartner with Product and Design to simplify complex workflows into accessible UI patterns\n\nContribute to foundational UI architecture that enables AI-driven and team-specific UX extensibility\n\nHelp evolve Zapier’s editor with a strong emphasis on performance, flexibility, and scalability\n\nThe Troubleshooting team ensures automations run smoothly—and when they don’t, users have the tools to understand why. This team is focused on preventing, detecting, and resolving workflow errors with clarity and speed.\n\nIn this role, you’ll:\n\nCreate clear, actionable UI surfaces to help users detect, debug, and resolve Zap errors\n\nBuild reusable components and data visualizations that support transparency and insight into automation behavior\n\nCollaborate closely with Support and Product to translate user pain points into effective frontend experiences\n\nImprove observability of automation runs through the user interface\n\nThe Functions team is building Zapier’s code-first automation experience — designed for developers who want maximum flexibility when building workflows. With support for coding, testing, secrets, and deployment in one place, Functions brings the power of automation to users who want to work directly in code.\n\nThis team is also exploring the future of code-based building at Zapier — unifying the best parts of our code-driven products into a more seamless experience. If you’re excited about developer platforms, scalable infrastructure, and building tools that help users automate complex business processes with code, this is the team for you.\n\nIf you enjoy solving messy problems, closing feedback loops, and turning complexity into clarity for users, this is a team where you’ll thrive.\n\nOur Commitment to Applicants\n\nCulture and Values at Zapier\n\nZapier Guide to Remote Work\n\nZapier Code of Conduct\n\nDiversity and Inclusivity at Zapier\n\nHigh Visibility, High Impact\nIf you thrive on building complex systems that are easy to use and hard to break, this zone is for you:\n\nWork on foundational systems used by millions\n\nHelp users build smarter, more powerful automations\n\nContribute to new AI-native experiences\n\nCollaborate with cross-functional teams across Product, Design, and Support\n\nJoin a high-ownership environment with clear user impact and fast iteration\n\nAbout You\nWe’re looking for experienced engineers who bring:\n\nDeep experience in React and TypeScript, including performance optimization, architecture, and advanced state management\n\nFor Full Stack roles: Advanced experience with Python/Django (and ideally frameworks like Next.js); you’re confident working across the stack and delivering scalable services\n\nExperience building and scaling design systems or reusable frontend platforms\n\nComfort architecting frontend systems that are secure, accessible, and maintainable at scale. Familiarity operating those systems, in production, for millions of users.\n\nA track record of collaborating closely with Product, Design, and cross-functional engineers to shape UX direction\n\nYou help grow your teammates by providing feedback, pairing on complex problems, and contributing to a culture of continuous learning\n\nYou navigate ambiguity with confidence, ask sharp questions, and help teams align on outcomes\n\nYou’ve used AI tooling for work or personal use. You explore new tools, workflows, and ideas to make things more efficient, and are eager to deepen your understanding of AI and use it regularly\n\nHow We Work\nZapier is a 100% remote team, and has been since day one. We value asynchronous communication, transparent collaboration, and work-life harmony. We believe in building systems that scale—both in code and in culture.\n\nIf you’re passionate about shaping the future of AI-driven automation, and want to work at a company that cares deeply about its people and its product, we’d love to hear from you."

These widgets had to use vanilla JS as we were not allowed access to their dependency library, and had to have excellent text coverage.\n**Skills**: Vanilla JS, unit testing\n\n## Google Partner Program\nThe reason I got the GCP professional Developer Certificate was to qualify as a contractor in the partner program. When Google had a partner that was interested in a new product they would bring me on to implement said product into the partner's platform. This required me to quickly learn the best practices for the new product and implement it in whatever language and frameworks the partner happened to be using.\n\n**Dialogflow & JLL**\nI was brought on to create a massive microservice architecture that sat behind an NLP interface. The app was a simple chat with a bot, but could do everything from schedule corporate meetings to order take out. The most requested feature was managing facilities requests. Namely temperature control.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, App Engine, GCP, StackTrace, GraphQL, Apollo, CircleCI, React, CodeClimate\n\n**Dialogflow & McDonalds**\nI was on a team that implemented McDonald's entire menu into a chat application for customer ordering. This allowed for substitutions and order modifications, as well as coupons and special codes.\n**Skills**: Dialogflow, Node, Express\n\n## Game servers\nIn a multiplayer video game context you cannot simply scale containers up and down to react to load like a normal application. Game servers is a GCP product that allows you to select a set of users for a \"match\" and assign them to a specific instance. the container is then automatically spun up and down for the duration of the match.\n**Skills**: Python, gRPC, Docker\n\n## Bartendro\nAn open source cocktail mixing machine. We rebuilt the UI and implemented a containerized server that communicated with the hardware. We added observability, remote updates, remote monitoring, and cloud menu management.\n**Skills**: Docker, Django, Python, React, Raspberry Pi\n\n## Driver's Benefits\nThe client had a massive HIPAA compliant Salesforce instance for case management. Their goal was to help gig workers, specifically drivers, obtain health care through government assistance. We helped them update their workflow to adhere to software best practices, like IAC and unit testing, while maintaining HIPAA compliance.\n**Skills**: Salesforce, Java (Apex)",

            "content": "As a lifelong type 1 diabetic (diagnosed at 18 months), I’ve always had a distinct perspective on risk and responsibility. Confronting mortality so young meant learning to enjoy life and pursue goals, playing on sports teams, traveling, without compromising my ability to manage my condition. Living with continual frustrations taught me to stay calm where others might panic; I make sound decisions under pressure and handle situations appropriately.\n\nI studied music at UCSC after being awarded the Regents Scholarship (a full ride for grades and test scores). I originally started as a dual major in Physics and Chemistry, but quickly realized that, during a period of growth and experimentation, music was more engaging than mathematics. In the electronic music program, I discovered computers as a creative medium for music, video, and interactivity. That exploration led me to build a Max/MSP program that triggered lighting and video changes based on musical events, using an adaptive listening algorithm informed by music theory. That project launched my tech career.\n\nAs I developed the tool further, I adopted TouchDesigner, extending the system with GLSL and Python. I began building installations for large social media companies, bridging the gap between their online following and live events. The goal was to create a feedback loop between celebrities and their followers (moderated by a marketing team). These experiences reinforced my ability to perform under pressure: live broadcasts that depended on my tools reached millions of viewers and allowed no delays. I had to deliver zero-tolerance software with no room for error.\n\nThroughout my career, I’ve enjoyed applying professional skills to artistic endeavors, especially those that build community. I grew up working in my father’s CNC machine shop, and it has never occurred to me that there’s anything I can’t create (which has also led to many valuable learning opportunities). Trying, adapting, and overcoming new challenges has been part of my personality for as long as I can remember. Not knowing exactly how to do something is a powerful motivator; learning is a reward beyond the success of any single project.\n\nUsing technology to foster connection is a big part of my life. Professionally, that meant strengthening relationships between a brand and its customers, and later between users and the tools I built. In personal projects, I focused on bringing people together, sometimes by crafting fun, engaging environments, and other times by proposing playful icebreakers and ways to interact that go beyond small talk without being intrusive.\n\nAs a creative technologist and community leader, I thrive in social environments where teams work toward a common goal. I handle pressure well and even enjoy it in moderation. Wherever life leads me, I plan to keep living these ideals in both my professional and personal life.",

That project taught me the power of seamless integration and user-friendly interfaces, something I see reflected in Zapier’s mission to make automation accessible and intuitive for everyone. I’m thrilled at the idea of contributing to a team that’s redefining how people interact with technology.",

This experience honed my skills in building robust systems that handle complex workflows, much like the challenges Zapier tackles in the Workflow Zone. I’ve architected APIs and async job pipelines that stabilized workloads under high demand, ensuring reliability and performance - key aspects of Zapier’s mission to enhance user confidence in automation.",
            "Beyond the technical side, I’ve always valued collaboration and learning. Whether it was working with Amazon’s team to align on system requirements or partnering with cross-functional teams at OPNA dev to design user-focused products, I thrive in environments where diverse ideas come together to create innovative solutions. I’m particularly drawn to Zapier’s commitment to remote work and asynchronous communication, which aligns perfectly with my belief in flexible, balanced work environments."
